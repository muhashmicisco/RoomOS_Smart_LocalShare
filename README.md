For rooms with outside roombooking panels, occupancy may not be correctly reflected. This Js xAPI macro aims to resolve that by monitoring the roomâ€™s occupancy and the screen share status. <br><br>It checks the occupancy every 2 minutes and displays a warning (for 55s) if the room is empty for two consecutive checks.<br>

After the warning, it stops the screen share after 1 minute.<br>
